RDS - Relational database service
it's managed db service for db use sql as a query language.
we can create db in cloud this db managed by aws itself..

it Supports: maridb, postress, mysql, oracle..

automate storage scaling: let say we set a storage, but it going behind
 the storage..aws will automatically auto scale the storage.


Advantage :
    - scaling storage capabilities
    - multi az setup for dr
    - read replicas for improved read performance...
    - monitoring dashboard..

Read replicas
    - we can setup up to 15 read replicas
    - using this read replicas, we can offload the work of primary db to this
    read replicas.
    - in this read replica, only read operations is only possibe.(which means select)
    - within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross region
    - Replication is aysnc(which means without acknowledgemnet its send the data)

e.g let say i have an e-commerce application that is experiencing heavy
traffic..in this case i can create read replicas..our main db will handle
all the write operations...our read replicas will handle all the read
operations

multi-az
    - in multi az aws automatically creates a stanby replica of the primary db in different az.
    - primary db handles all the read and write, while stanby db will do synchronous Replication.
    whatever any changes made to primary db are immediately copied to stanby db.
    - if any hardware issue, az fail, network outrage..aws will automatically promote the stanby
    to new primary.

RDS - From single-Az to multi-Az
    - when we we select this as multi-az 
    - in the backend a snapshot taken of our db 
    - and restored as a stanby db in another az
    - sync Replication is established between the db

custom RDS
    if we use rds custom - u will not set storage autoscaling, multi az Supports and read replica.
    it Supports microsfot sql and oracle.
        - it will be hosted on ec2 instance
        - u will get a root access
        - install custom db extension or patches
        - configure the os
