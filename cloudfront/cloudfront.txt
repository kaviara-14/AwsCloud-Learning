1. cloud front
    we can cache them in them edge location.

    - let say i am in us and accessing the s3 bucket in Australia.
    - first the request will go through the edge location, from there 
    it will go to s3 bucket in Australia using aws private network.
    - edge location will cache the request and store 
    - someone is requesting the same content..it will serve quickly from 
    the edge location.

    - content is delivered from edge.

    - cloud front for s3 bucket
    - cloud front for ec2/alb .
    - cloud front for geo-location - we can allowlist or blocklist the country

2. AWS global accelerator
    - no caching
    - network traffic routing to imporive perfomrance.

    let say i have a application deployed in india it's alb.
    i want customer from us, france, japan can access it.

    i will use this aws global accelerator, with this customer in us can talk to 
    the neaby edge location..from the edge location..
    they will routed to aws load balancer in india via private network.
