1. EC2 instance(infrastructure as a service)
    - Elastic compute cloud
    - it's a virtual server
    - On top of ec2 instance, we can host our application

With Ec2 we will do
    - store datta on virtual drives(ebs)
    - distrubute load across machine(els)
    - scaling the service using an automatically(asg)

security group control inbound and outbound traffic in ec2 instance

2. different types of EC2 instance
    - General purpose
        * web servers (or) code repositories
    - compute optimized 
        * great for compute intesive task that require high performance like 
        gaming server, machine learning models.
    - memory optimized
        * Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
        like high performance databases
    - storgae optimized
        storgae intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets 
        on local storgae
    - accelerated cloud compute


3. based on the application we will choose instance type..based on this cpu,
memory and storgae instance type will vary

4. with key pair..we can login to the instance from the local

5. ports 
    22 - ssh into ec2 instance
    21 - ftp 
    22 - sftp - upload files using ssh.
    80 - http access unsecured website
    443 - https - access secured website 
    3389 - rdp

6. we can attach iam role to ec2 instance

7. Spot instance : spot instance are un-used ec2 instance that user can use at a reduced cost.
    On demand instance : pay as you go..

8. - public ip - anyone can access from the world wide web
    - private ip - u r only accessible within your private network.
    connect to internet using internet gateway(as a proxy)

9. if u need a fixed public ip for your instance - u need Elastic ip.

10. placement groups   
    we want to have control over how ec2 instance are going to be placed
    within the aws infrastructure.
    * cluster - all the ec2 instance are in same az..if one fails..everything is gone.
    * spread - we can spread our ec2 across multiple az..we can reduce the risk
    * partition - partition are racks,spread across each az..safe rack failure from one another.

11. ENI - Elastic network interface
    it is a Virtual network card..
    so they are what gives ec2 instance access to internet..
    create a secondary eni with private ip  can be moved across multiple ec2 instance for failover

12. if we hibernate - ec2 RAM will be dumped into our ebs volume,
once instance running, ram will be loaded to ec2 instance from ebc

13. AMI - application machine Image
    AMI is a package that contains operating system , configuration , software and monitoring to launch an ec2 instance
    it is bounded by region u can create your own ami and copy that across multiple region
