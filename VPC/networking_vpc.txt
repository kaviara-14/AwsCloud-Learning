VPC - Virtual private cloud while creating vpc..we will assign ip address range using cidr block 172.2.0.0/16 - 6553 Ip address

for Subnet - we will break the ip address range assign ip address range for each Subnet

1. Internet Gateway - Internet Gateway allows resource in a vpc connect to the Internet.
using Internet Gateway user can access your vpc Public Subnet.

2. Public Subnet(load balancer) - in Public Subnet we have a load balancer - that forwards the traffic
3. Route table - route table route your request from load balancer to the actual ec2
4. Security group - will validate your incoming request 
5. private Subnet(ec2 instance) - once validate our request will reach ec2 instance in private Subnet.
6. using NAT Gateway - we can connect the private Subnet ec2 instance to the Internet.
 it masks the ec2 ip address(Public Subnet)
Route :private Subnet(route table) - nat Gateway - Internet Gateway

7. NACL - Network Activity control list is stateless.

    * we can use this NACL to add Security in Subnet level
    * NACL will allow or deny the request.
    * since it's stateless both incoming and outgoing request are evaluated
    * higher precdence for a lower number, lat role is streak(*)
    * if we have 100 ec2 instance, using NACL we can add Security group to all 100 ec2 instance.
    * if something is blocked in NACL level, it will not allow inside in the ec2 instance.

8. Security group is stateful
    * Security group we can add it in ec2 instance level.
    * since it is a stateful, it will have the knowldege of incoming request, so it will allow outgoing request automatically
    * let say if port 8080 denied in nacl level but Security group allowed port 8080...the request will be blocked in nacl level.


9. stateful means it remembers the incoming request and allow the outgoing request automatically.
stateless means every request is idependent


Depth concept

1. CIDR - Classless Inter domain routing
    * method for allocating ip address.
    base ip : 10.1.12.1
    Subnet mask : how many bits can change in the ip. /0,/24,/32.
    /8 - 255.0.0.0
    /16- 255.255.0.0
    /24 - 255.255.255.0
    /32 - 255.255.255.255

    deep dive :
        * 192.164.0.0/32 - 2 power 0 - 1 ip.
        * 192.164.0.0/31 - 2 power 1 - 2 ip(192.164.0.0,192.164.0.1)
        .
        .
        * /29 - 2 power 3 - 8 ip.
        */24 - 2 power 8 - 256 ip.
        * 16- 2 power 16 - 65,536 ip
        * 8 - 2 power 24 - 
        * 0.0.0.0/0 - all ips.

2. we can have 5 ipv4 cidr in our vpc - that's the limit

3. AWS will reserve 5 ip address in each Subnet.(first 4, last 1)
    10.0.0.0 - Network address
    10.0.0.1 - reserved for aws for vpc router
    10.0.0.2 - mapping dns
    10.0.0.3 - future use
    10.0.0.255 - network broadcast private..aws doesn't support broadcast in vpc.

4. if your ec2 instance in Public Subnet it's not getting Internet access even after u used
Internet Gateway.
    check the route table,using this only ec2 instance connect to the Internet.

5. Bastion host
    * using Bastion host, we can ssh into private ec2 instance
    * the Bastion host is in Public Subnet
    * make sure only few ip address are allowed
    * using Bastion host,we can install packages, any software, upgrades to private
    ec2 instance
    * make sure in private ec2 instance Security grp, allow ssh into bastion host Security grp.

6. ephemeral ports

    Ephemeral ports are temporary, short-lived ports used by a client machine to establish a connection to a server.
    client sends the request to server(server ip,port) and server responds back to the client(client ip,port):
        - source ip : machine ip 
          source port : os port

        - dest ip : server ip
            dest port: 443

    * Ephemeral ports are temporary and are used solely to maintain the communication for the duration of the connection.
    * Reuse: Once the connection is closed, the ephemeral port is freed and can be reused for future connections.


7. VPC Peering - using vpc Peering we can privately connect two vpc.
                - make sure no overlap between cidrs.
                - make them behave as if they were in the same network.
                * cross account/region
        e.g vpcA - vpcB(connect using vpc peering)

8. vpc endpoints..
    let say in my vpc i have ec2 instance in private Subnet, using vpc endpoints i can privately
    communicate with other aws services like dynamodb, s3 and cloud watch.
    without going through Public Internet

    tow types :
        * interface endpoints(ENI)
            - supports all services
            - pay per use
        * Gateway endpoints (Route table)
            - supports s3 and dynamodb services
            - free

9. vpc flowlogs
    * capture information about the ip traffic going to and from your network interface in your network.
    they provide detail information including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
    3 kinds of flowlogs
        - vpc flow logs
        - Subnet flow logs
        - elastic network interface flow logs
    * helps to troubleshoot & monitor connectivity issues

    Architecure :
        vpc flowlogs - cloudwatch logs - cloudwatch contributor insights(top 10 ip address)


10. connect vpc to on-premises privately?

we can use site-to-site vpn connection

attach vpn gateway in vpc and attach customer gateway in on-premises..
using this we will do site to site vpn connection privately using Public  network

11. AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables multiple VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect connections to be connected through a single gateway

supports ip multicast

12. How does a Transit Gateway simplify VPC and VPN connectivity?
     Transit Gateway acts as a central hub that allows you to connect multiple VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect connections.
      This reduces the need for complex VPC peering arrangements or VPN connections.


11. using traffic mirroring, we can inspect the traffic or filter the traffic..
going through in our vpc

12. ipv6 - 3.4*10 power 38 ip address
    no private range for ipv6 in aws, all are Public
    u can enable ipv6 to operate as dual-stack mode
    communicate through Internet gateway.

    u r ec2 instance will get private ipv4 and Public ipv6

13. egress-only Internet gateway used for connecting Internet to ipv6 private ec2 instance. only outbound is possible
incoming is disabled.
