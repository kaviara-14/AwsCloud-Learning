1. AWS lambda
    - aws lambda is a serverless which means we don't need to create or configure any servers, it is taken care by aws itself.
    - we can write code and deploy, aws take care of everything
    - aws lambda will not run automatically, we can need to configure an event...like from from cloudwatch or s3..etc.,
    - once the execution is completed it will tear down the infrastructure..it created..pay as u go..
    - each lambda function will have a role attached..role only define wht services lambda can access or not

2. benefits 
    - if we want we can increase the memory and execution time, we can do.
    - lambda can use 1000 concurrent function by default, we can set a concurrent limit to each function.
    - environment variables are key-value pairs, we can store the configuration settings & sensitive information
    - can we use to cloudwatch to monitor the execution

2. lambda supporting language
    - python
    - nodejs
    - java
    - go
    - .net core 
    - ruby

3. Limitation of lambda
    - The memory allocation for a Lambda function ranges from 128 MB to 10 GB
    - The maximum execution time for a Lambda function is 15 minutes (900 seconds)
    - The total size of environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB
    - disk capacity in the function container is between 512 MB to 10GB.
    - Lambda supports 1,000 concurrent executions per account per region.

    - the maximum size of compressed zip is 50.
    - size of uncompressed zip is 250 mb
    - can use /tmp directory to load other files at startup

4. reserved concurrency
    - we can set limit of lambda function, let say this lambda function
    only have 50 concurrent execution.
    - each invocation over the concurrency limit will trigger throttle.

    for async invocation : it will keep on retry for 6 hours..retry interval between 1 seconds to 5 minutes.

5. what is cold start and how provision concurrency helps
    whenever the function is triggered for the first name or it is triggering back after the 
    long time..it will be slow execution..because it needs to intialize the code & dependencies..it will take some time ..

    using provision concurrency..we can set few lambda in always warm.
    and concurrency is allocated before the function is invoked.

6. lambda snapstart
    - improve your lambda performance upto to 10x and above for java
    - when enabled, function is invoked from pre-package state..

7. customation at CDN Content(edge) 

You can run custom JavaScript or Python/Node.js code at these edge locations to 
modify requests or responses based on your business logic (e.g., authentication,
 content personalization, A/B testing, geolocation-based routing
cloudfront function and lambda@edge..

cloudfront function(managed by cloudfront)
    - javascript code
    - handles millions of request per seconds
    - cloud front modify viewer request/viewer response
    - max execution time < 1 ms

lambda@edge
    - python or nodejs
    - thousad of request per seconds
    - cloudfront modify viewer request/viewer response and origin function and origin response
    - max.execution time 5-10 seconds

8. Lambda function in vpc.

    let say i want to access a rds database in a private subnet.it's inside a vpc..how will i do..

    1. first, while creating a lambda function..choose the vpc and select a private subnet and attach a security group.
    2. so this will create a eni in private subnet..with the help of eni lambda can access the rds database in private subnet

9. use rds proxy

    in the above case whenever the code is concurrently executed...lambda function will open a new connection in rds database.so there are too many
    open connection..database will have high latency...we can handles this using rds proxy..

    RDS proxy pools and manages connections, reducing the number of connections directly to the database..rds proxy will use existing connection for multiple invocations

10.RDS Invoking lambda and event notification

    - RDS can be configured to trigger a Lambda function, enabling actions like processing newly added records or sending notifications to users.

    - RDS Event Notifications allow you to monitor changes in the RDS environment, such as database instance creation, deletion, backups, or failures.
    you don't get information about the data.

11. API Gateway
    In API Gateway, we can create REST APIs to create methods like GET, POST, DELETE, and more. These methods can be configured to trigger an AWS Lambda function
    to handle the request and process the response.

    e.g..for get method..i will lambda function to get all the data..

12. STEP function

    build serverless visual workflow to orchestrate your lambda function.

    features: parallel, sequence, conditions, error handling..

    can intergrate with ec2,ecs, on-premise server, api Gateway, sqs queue etc.

    possibility for implementing human approval features.

13. Cognito
    give user identity to interact with our web or mobile
    * Cognito user pool - sign in functionality for app users.
    * Cognito identity pool - give aws credentails to users so they can access resorce temporary
