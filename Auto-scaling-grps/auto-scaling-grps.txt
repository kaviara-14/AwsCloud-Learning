Auto scaling group

The goal is ,
    * scale out(add ec2 instance) to match an increase load
    * scale in(remove ec2 instance) to match decrease load

* if one ec2 instance is unhealthy, another ec2 instance will be created.

    we can either set maximum, desired and minimum capacity = manually
    or we can use cloud watch alarm to monitor the cpu, if our cpu goes hhigh
    we can scale in and if we cpu goes down..it will automatically scale out..
    ALB distrubute traffic to all ec2 instance

* if elb deemed an instance unhealthy, asg will terminate the ec2


scaling policies :

    * dynamic scaling

        Target tracking system : 
            - simple to setup
            - eg: i want the average asg cpu to say at round 40%
        simple/step scaling :
            - when cloud watch alarm triggere(example cpu > 70%), then add 2 units
            - when cloud watch alarm triggere(example cpu < 30%), remove 1 .

    * scheduled scaling :
            eg: increase the min capacity to 10 at 5 pm on fridays.
        
    * predective scaling :
            - analyse the histrocial loads
            - generate forecast
            - schedule scaling actions

scaling cooldown - 5 mins default

during the cooldown period, the asg will not lauch or terminate additional ec2 instance
