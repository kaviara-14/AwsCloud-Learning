1. Your company has several EC2 instances running in a production environment.
 The team wants to optimize costs but ensure minimal performance impact. How would you approach this problem?
    - I will use spot instance for unused ec2 instance
    - I setup asg group with target tracking policy to scale in and scale out based on the cpu utilization.
    - for predictable workloads i will use reservered instance


2. You are asked to design a highly available architecture for a critical application using EC2 instances. 
What steps would you take to ensure high availability?

    - i will create a ec2 instance in different az.
    - use elastic load balancer to forward  the traffic to ec2 instance
    -use asg ,to scale-in and scale-out based on the request 

3. One of your EC2 instances becomes unreachable due to an underlying hardware failure. 
What steps would you take to recover the instance?
    - if is asg group, it will automatically launch a ec2 instance

4. You have an application that requires extremely low-latency communication between instances. How can you achieve this on Amazon EC2?
    i will use placement groups, using placement groups we can control, how ec2 instance placed in the aws infrastructure..
    cluster ip - placement strategy

5.Your application needs to store sensitive data, and you want to ensure that the data is encrypted at rest on EC2 instances.
 How can you enable this encryption?

i will use ebs volume with encryption enabled..

6. Your application requires GPU capabilities for machine learning or graphics-intensive workloads.
 How can you launch EC2 instances with GPU support?
    Aws ec2 p3 instance - ideal for machine learning workloads.
    aws ec2 g4 instance - graphical intensive workloads like gaming

7. You need to ensure that your EC2 instances are running in a private network and are not directly accessible from the internet. 
How can you achieve this?

i will setup a basiton host 

8.You want to enhance the security of your EC2 instances by restricting incoming traffic only to specific IP addresses.
 How can you implement this security measure?

i will specify that address in security group.

9. Your organization needs to store and share data files across multiple EC2 instances. 
What service can you use to achieve scalable and durable file storage?

    - i will use efs ..it's a network file system..
    - using efs we can connect to multiple ec2 instance in different az .
    - in efs, we have Lifecycle also
        standard - store frequently accesed files
        efs- Ia - for infrequent access files
        archieve - for rarely acc files

10. Your application requires the ability to quickly recover from instance failure and ensure data durability.
 What type of Amazon EBS volume is recommended for such scenarios?

 - i will use I/o family - this for high performance and critical performance

11. Your organization needs to control the launch permissions of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and prevent accidental termination of EC2 instances.
 What AWS service can help you manage these permissions effectively?

    You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage launch permissions
    for AMIs and control who can launch instances from specific AMIs.

12. Q : Your organization needs to host a web application that requires consistent CPU performance and low latency. 
Which EC2 instance type would you recommend, and why?

 I will use memory optimized.with the “c5” instances offering higher CPU performance and 
 the “m5” instances providing a balance of compute and memory resources.

13. Your organization wants to reduce costs for development and testing environments, 
which are only required during specific hours of the day. How can you achieve cost savings?

    - EC2 instance scheduler will only allows you to automatically start and stop EC2 instances based on a defined schedule, 

14. Your application needs to support both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
. How can you ensure that EC2 instances can handle both types of traffic?
    - we need to enable dual stack network on your vpc.this will allow our ec2 instance connect to both  

15. you have been assigned to design a vpc architecture for a 2-tier application.
The application needs to be highly scalable and available.
How would u design the vpc architecture

    - I will create 2 subnet Public subnet and private subnet.
    - I will host my application in private subnets. in Public i will have my
    - load balancer and can be accessible from the internet.

    - i would distribute the subnet across multiple availability zone for high
    availability.Additionaly, i would configure auto scaling group
    for the application server.

16. your organization has a vpc with multiple subnets.you want to restirct
outbound internet access for resources in one subnet.by allow outbound
internet access for resources in another subnet. how do u achieve this ?

    - we can modify the route table associated with that subnet.in the route table,
    we can remove the default route(9.0.0.0/0) that points to internet
    gateway.

    this would prevent resources in that subnet from accessing the internet.
    for the subnet, where outbound internet access is required, we can 
    keep the default route pointing to internet gateway

17.You have a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet.
 Instances in the private subnet need to access the internet for software updates. 
 How would you allow internet access for instances in the private subnet?

    I will place my Nat gateway in a public subnet.

    using the nat gateway, instance in the private gateway can access the 
    internet.basically it will mask the instance ip and places the nat gateway
    public subnet ip address.

    in the route table of the ec2 instance, i will allow outbound traffic to nat gateway.

18. Q: You have launched EC2 instances in your VPC, 
and you want them to communicate with each other using private IP addresses.
 What steps would you take to enable this communication?

    -By default, instances within the same VPC can communicate with each other using private IP addresses. 
   - (vpc peering) To ensure this communication, we need to make sure that the instances are launched in the same VPC and are placed in the same subnet or subnets that are connected through a peering connection or a VPC peering link. 
  - Additionally, we should check the security groups associated with the instances to ensure that the necessary inbound and outbound rules are configured to allow communication between them.

19.You want to implement strict network access control for your VPC resources. How would you achieve this?

    - explain about NACL
    - NACL are stateless..why stateless because all the traffic are independent.
    - NACL acts as a security in subnet level.
    - since it is stateless, both inbound and outbound request are evaluated.
    - using Nacl, We can perform allow or deny request.
    - rule numbers will be given priority based on the lowest number.

    by carefully configuring nacl rules, we can enfore fine-grained
    access contorol for traffic entering and leaving the subnets

20.Your organization requires an isolated environment within the VPC for running sensitive workloads. 
How would you set up this isolated environment?

    i will use private subnet and i will not provide any internet access to that subnet.
    so that it will isolated environment in my vpc.

    if only requires i will user nat gateway.

21.Your application needs to access AWS services, such as S3 securely within your VPC.
 How would you achieve this?

 To securely access AWS services within the VPC, we can use VPC endpoints.
  VPC endpoints allow instances in the VPC to communicate with AWS services privately, 
  without requiring internet gateways or NAT gateways. 

  in vpc endpoints, i will use gateway endpoint 


22. What is the difference between NACL and Security groups ? Explain with a use case ?

    For example, I want to design a security architecture, I would use a combination of NACLs and security groups. At the subnet level, I would configure NACLs to enforce inbound and outbound traffic restrictions based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. NACLs are stateless and can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering traffic at the subnet boundary.
  At the instance level, I would leverage security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups are stateful and operate at the instance level. By carefully defining security group rules, I can allow or deny specific traffic to and from the instances based on the application's security requirements.
  By combining NACLs and security groups, I can achieve granular security controls at both the network and instance level, providing defense-in-depth for the sensitive application.

23. What is the smallest and largest VPC CIDR block you can create? 
    The smallest VPC CIDR block is a /28 (16 IPv4 addresses). The largest is a /16 (65,536 IPv4 addresses). AWS Reservs 5 IP Addresses, do minus -5 to get usable IPs count.

24. What is the difference between a public subnet and a private subnet in a VPC?
 A public subnet has a route to the internet, typically through an Internet Gateway. A private subnet doesn't have a direct route to the internet.

25.How does routing work within a VPC? 
 Each subnet in a VPC has a route table associated with it. 
 The route table specifies how traffic is directed in and out of the subnet.
Routes can point to the internet gateway, Virtual Private Gateway, NAT Gateway, or VPC peering connection.

26. What is the purpose of a route table in a VPC? 
A route table in a VPC determines where network traffic is directed. It specifies the next hop for traffic based on its destination.

27. How are Flow Logs useful for network troubleshooting and security analysis?
 Flow Logs can be analyzed to troubleshoot network connectivity issues, monitor traffic patterns, 
 and identify potential security risks or unusual activity in your VPC.

28. Are there any limitations or quotas on VPC resources? 
    Maximum VPCs per Region: 5 VPCs (this can be increased by submitting a request to AWS support).
    Maximum CIDR Block per VPC: 5 IPv4 CIDR blocks and 5 IPv6 CIDR blocks per VPC (you can associate multiple CIDR blocks with a VPC using secondary CIDR blocks).
    Maximum VPC Peering Connections: 50 peering connections per VPC by default.
    Maximum Route Tables: 200 route tables per VPC.
    Maximum Subnets per VPC: 200 subnets per VPC.

29. Explain the significance of S3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) and S3 Bucket Policies for fine-grained access control.

    * using Bucket policy we can allow or deny permissions in Bucket level .
    * ACL will allow you to add allow or deny permissions in both object level and bucket level

30. wht is the purpose of s3 select
    using s3 select, we can retrieve the specific set of data's from the object...

31. Explain how to transfer large volumes of data to and from S3 efficiently, especially for migration and data backup purposes.
    - we can use snowball device 
    - we can use aws datasync
    - we break the file upload into s3 

32. Explain the differences between server-side encryption options in S3, including SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, and SSE-C. When would you use each of these options?

— SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys): In this option, Amazon S3 manages the encryption keys. It’s a good choice for simplicity and is suitable for most use cases.
— SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service): SSE-KMS allows you to use AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys. It provides more control and auditing capabilities and is ideal for compliance requirements.
— SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys): SSE-C enables you to use your own encryption keys, and you are responsible for key management. This is suitable for scenarios where you want complete control over the keys.

33. Explain how you can control costs when using S3 storage classes, especially in a large-scale environment.
    - Use s3 Lifecycle policy
    - use se intelligent tiering

34. How does versioning work in S3, and what are the benefits and considerations for enabling it?
    - Enable versioning in s3 bucket.
    - once u enabled, already existing data considered as null version.
    - if u upload a existing file, it will not be replaced..but it will be version..i have older object copy also..if i want i can restore.
    - if i am delteing any object..it will not be deleted...aws add delete-marker,.if u want we can restore..

35. AWS Glue
        - AWS Glue is a etl service move and prepare data for analytics. with this aws glue..we can extract the information from any where..
        tranform the data into required format and load into any one of the analytics server like Amazon s3 and aws redshift.

36. how do u generate a pre-signed url in lambda function?
    in lambda, there is function called
        generate_presigned_url('get_object',params={bucket name,key}, expiresin=3600)
    
37. You are working with an S3 bucket that stores backup data. The backup data needs to be retained for 5 years, and after that, it should be deleted.
 How would you set up the data retention policy in S3?

    in the lifecycle policy i will store the data s3 glacier deep archieve, so that it will be retained whenever we needed

        After transitioning your backup data to Glacier Deep Archive,
    you can set the expiration rule in the lifecycle policy to delete objects after 5 years, as per your requirement.

38. How does Amazon S3 handle data replication for disaster recovery purposes?
    Amazon S3 offers two types of replication — Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and Same-Region Replication (SRR) — that allow you to replicate your data to different AWS regions or within the same region, respectively.
    This helps in ensuring high availability and disaster recovery of your data.
