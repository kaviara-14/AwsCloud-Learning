* users - we create a user with strong password to access aws and attach a policy.

* groups - collection of users that shares same permission is called group.

* policy - we can attach policy to group or user, so that we can give them a least privelages to access the service.

* roles 
    - for aws service to service communication, we can create a role attach a policy, so that service can commicate with the other service.
    e.g my ec2 instance needs upload or download files from s3 bucket..i will create a role with s3 full access attach to aws ex2 instance.

    - cross Account access, with cross Account..i can access another account services

* organizations
    - we have one management account, inside that we can create multiple organizational units(ou).
    - devolpers(ou), production(ou)..we can add accounts in this ou.
    Advantages : 
        * centralized management..we can attach policy or remove policy in a go.
        * consolidated management for all accounts in a single payments.

* role rotation
    - when we create a role, role rotation automatically create a temporary credentails
    - aws create temporary credentails, valid only for few hours..it will be refresh after few hours..we can achieve security

* resource based policy
   
    Attached directly to a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket, Lambda function, or SNS topic).
    Specifies who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it.
    Example: An S3 bucket policy that allows a specific IAM user or aws service to access the bucket.

IAM Roles:
    Attached to IAM users, groups, or services (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
    Roles are assumed by trusted entities to gain temporary permissions.
    Example: An EC2 instance assumes an IAM role that allows it to access an S3 bucket.

Resource-Based Policies:

    Attached directly to a resource (e.g., an S3 bucket, Lambda function, or SNS topic).
    Specifies who can access the resource and what actions they can perform on it.
    Example: An S3 bucket policy that allows a specific IAM user or aws service to access the bucket.
