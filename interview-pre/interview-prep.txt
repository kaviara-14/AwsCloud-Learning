1. Your company has several EC2 instances running in a production environment.
 The team wants to optimize costs but ensure minimal performance impact. How would you approach this problem?
    - I will use spot instance for unused ec2 instance
    - I setup asg group with target tracking policy to scale in and scale out based on the cpu utilization.
    - for predictable workloads i will use reservered instance


2. You are asked to design a highly available architecture for a critical application using EC2 instances. 
What steps would you take to ensure high availability?

    - i will create a ec2 instance in different az.
    - use elastic load balancer to forward  the traffic to ec2 instance
    -use asg ,to scale-in and scale-out based on the request 

3. One of your EC2 instances becomes unreachable due to an underlying hardware failure. 
What steps would you take to recover the instance?
    - if is asg group, it will automatically launch a ec2 instance
