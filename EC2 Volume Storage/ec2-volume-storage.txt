1. EBS Volume
    - Elastic block store - network drive.
    - it uses network to connect to the ec2 instance
    - we can attach ebs volume to the ec2 instance..
    - even if the ec2 instance deleted(delete on termination - No), the instance data will presist...
    - we can create a new one attach the ebs volume..
    - ebs can't be attached to multiple ec2 instance..but ec2 can have multiple
    ebs volume.
        only for io1/io2 family - we can attach volume to multiple ec2 instance
    - ebs bound to specific az.
    - we can detach and attach to another ec2 instance quickly

2. ebs volume type
    - gp2/gp3 - General purpose SSD (cost effective storgae with low latency)
    - io1/io2 - critical business application with high iops performance e.g databases
    - st1 - low cost HDD, frequest access and intensive workloads
    - sc1 - low cost HDD, less frequently accesed workloads.

SSD - Solid state disk = high performance, pricey
HDD - Hard drive disk = cheaper, low latency




3. EBS Snapshot
    - can copy Snapshot across az or region
    - create a Snapshot for ebs volume in one az .
    - restore the Snapshot as ebs volume in another az.

    EBS Snapshot Features
        - EBS Snapshot Archieve - move our Snapshot to Archieve tier for lower cost range..takes 24 to 72 take a backup.
        - Recycle bin for ebs Snapshot: recover the deleted Snapshot within range, accedentaily deleted it will be re-stored..sepecify retention(1 day to a year)
        - fast Snapshot restore - we can restore the ebs Snapshot to the volume much faster.


4. if u need a high performance hardware disk - use ec2 instance store
    - better i/o performance
    - if u stopped ec2 instance storgae will be lost(ephemeral)


5. ebs encryption
    when u create a ebs 
        - data at rest will be encrypted inside the volume 
        - all data in flight movinf instance to volume is encrypted
        - all Snapshot encrypted
        - all volume created from the Snapshot encrypted
    
    encryption and decryption are handled tranparently by ebs volume and 
    Snapshot itself.

6. EFS - Elastic file system - only for linux ami
    - it's a network file system that cann be mounted on many ec2 instance.
    - efs works with ec2 instance in multiple-az
    - encrypt at rest using kms.

    Lifecycle managent storage class :
        - standard: frequently accesed files 
        - efs-ia: for infrequent access
        - Archieve - rarely used files
