1. Encryption in flight(Tls) - transport layer security

    * client sends the request to server, before sending to server..
    * we will use tls encryption mechanism to encypt the data..at the client side
    only the server can decrpyt the encrypted the data suing tls decrpytion.
    * tls helps https 

2. server side encryption 
    server will encypt the data before storing and decrpyt the data while sending
    back to client

3. client side encryption
    client side will encypt the data, store it to server as encrypted data..
    while client requesting the data..we will decrypt and show to the client

4. KMS - Key Management service
    
    Using aws kms key we can encrypt and decrypt the data using key.

    let say i want to store a credit card details in amazon s3.

    i will create kms customer master key, here we have 2 types symmetric or ay symmetric.

    symmetric - we will use one key for both encrypt and decrpyt
    ay symmetric - we will use 2 keys one for encrypt and one for decrpyt.

    i will create a key with symmetric..once i created..use this key i will encrypt the credit card details

    attach a policy : only few iam users can decrpyt the data..

    i will encrypt the data and store in s3 bucket..

    if i want to retrieve i will use the same key to decrpyt the data

    rotation : if i want i can maually rotate the key and if not we can set automatic rotation

5. SSM - AWS Storage Manager.

    In SSM we can store any configuration details or any sensitive information.
        - if it is a sensitive information, we can encrypt using KMS and store in ssm.
        - parameters will be stored in hierarical - so that we can organise the information
        - using ami policy we can restirct the users
        - it will provide versioning like who edited or modified

6. AWS Secret Manager

    - using aws Secret Manager, we can store the sensitive information like username, password, token securely.
    - aws Secret Manager automatically  encrypt and decrypt the data while storing and retrieving the data
    - it support rotation of the secrets for the periodic time
    - it will support auditing and monitoring.
    - using ami policy we can restirct the users

7. AWS Certificate Manager

    - using this aws Certificate Manager, we can deploy and manage tls Certificate to our application
    - so that it will be accessed by https

    attach the Certificate to load balancer, api gateway or cloud front

8. WAF(Web application firewall)

    - WAF works on the layer 7 which is application layer, it protects u from the web exploits or any sql injection attack

9. AWS Shiled protects you from DDOS attack which are attempts to overwhelm your application with too much traffic to make it slow or unavailable.
