Route53
    - Route53 provides DNS as a service. 

    Using DNS we can map our dns to the ip address

    Why do need Route53 ?
        * all our service uses ip only, ip address hard to remember.
        * ip address changes..
    
    - do a domain registration in route53 or it will accept third party domain.
    - in Hosted zone, we will map our registered domain to load balancer or any particular ip address.
    - do health checks also..whether the web servers are active or not. 

Public hosted zone :
    A Public Hosted Zone is used to manage DNS records for a domain
     that can be accessed over the internet.

private hosted zone
A Private Hosted Zone is used to manage DNS records for resources in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 
It allows DNS resolution for resources that are private and not accessible over the internet.

Key Points:
Used to route traffic for resources within a VPC.
Records in a private hosted zone are accessible only from resources inside the VPC(s) associated with the hosted zone.
