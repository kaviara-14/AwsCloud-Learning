    - 5x performance imporvement over mysql in rds and 3x performance over postgress in rds.
    - Aurora storage grows automatically from 10 gb to 129tb
    - Aurora can have up to 15 read replicas and the Replication process
    is faster than rds.
    - autoscaling for read replica

High Availability
    - takes 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ.
    - self healing with peer-to-peer Replication
    - shared storage volume
    - one Aurora instance takes write(master)
    - failover happens 30 seconds
    - we can have 15 read replicas server reads and we have master to write.
    - Supports Cross region Replication

    - Writer Endpoint
        (pointing to the master)
        client talks to the writer endpoint and redirect to master db (write)
    
    - Reader Endpoint 
        (point to read replicas)
        connection load balancing - connet automatically to reader endpoints
        client talks to reader endpoint and connected to anyone of the reader endpoint
